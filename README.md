Noah work:

So far, I've been following Pyro's compartmental model tutorials to build classes of the various compartment models, gradually ramping up to the kind we are most interested in, SEI3R. 

All of this can be seen in the notebooks repo, under the corresponding names. 

As of Thursday I've gotten fairly close, but am still stuck on computing the flow from the diferent compartments in SEI3R. Once that is done, the next thing is to generate data accordingly, meaning I need to figure out what the correct dataset conditions are (i.e R0, etc.) 

and after that figure out where in the transtion dynamics does the intervention parameter u show up. 

After all that we can play around with different values of U, and see how it changes the compartment flow for intervening in pandemics.
